# WebCL Resources
We believe the true usefulness of WebCL goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/blob/master/api/webcl/resources.md) and help maintain an up-to-date list of WebCL resources.

## Khronos Resources
* [Homepage](https://www.khronos.org/webcl/)
* [WebCL Registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webcl/)
* [WebCL Draft Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webcl/specs/latest/1.0/)

## Frameworks & Implementations
* [Crosswalk Project](https://crosswalk-project.org/) If you are a developer working with web technologies, the Crosswalk Project enables you to deploy a web application with its own dedicated runtime. As of Beta 14, the Crosswalk Project now supports WebCL.
* [Samsung WebCL](https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/webkit-webcl) Samsung open sourced prototype for WebKit. Built in WebCL & WebGL interoperability, i.e. no copying WebCL objects to WebGL and vice versa. 
* [Nokia WebCL](http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/) The WebCL project exposes OpenCL into JavaScript, allowing web developers to tap into the massive parallel computing resources of modern GPUs, multicore CPUs, and upcoming manycore accelerators. 
* [AMD Chromium WebCL](https://github.com/amd/Chromium-WebCL) WebCL implementation for Chromium. 
* [Rivertrail](https://github.com/rivertrail/rivertrail/wiki) JavaScript which supports Data Parallelism via OpenCL.
* [ETRI Chromium WebCL](https://github.com/highweb-project/highweb-webcl-html5spec)  implementation for Chromium running on Android.

## Utilities & Debug Helpers
* [WebCL Translator](https://github.com/wolfviking0/webcl-translator) WebCL-translator is an OpenCL to WebCL converter, it's based on the Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. 

## Tutorials, Technical Whitepapers and How to Guides
* [Nokia WebCL Tutorials](http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/tutorials/tutorials.html) This series of lessons will introduce you to WebCL programming, starting from the basics like WebCL context creation and kernel compilation. 

## Presentations, Videos & Demos
* [Path Tracer](https://github.com/stormcolor/webclgl) Javascript Library for general purpose computing on GPU, aka GPGPU.
* [Fractal Studio](http://fract.ured.me/)
