# OpenVX Resources

We believe the true usefulness of OpenVX goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg)!

## Commercial and Open Source Implementations
* [VisionWorks](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/visionworks) - NVIDIA VisionWorks toolkit is a software development package for computer vision (CV) and image processing. VisionWorks™ implements and extends the Khronos OpenVX standard, and it is optimized for CUDA-capable GPUs and SOCs enabling developers to realize CV applications on a scalable and flexible platform.
* [AMD OpenVX](http://gpuopen.com/compute-product/amd-openvx/) is a highly optimized open source implementation of the Khronos OpenVX™ computer vision specification. It is a library that allows for rapid prototyping as well as fast execution on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded x86 CPUs and large workstation discrete GPUs. On Github: [core (OpenVX)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Libraries/amdovx-core) and [modules (Libraries)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Libraries/amdovx-modules)
