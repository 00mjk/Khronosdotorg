# OpenXR Resources

We believe the true usefulness of OpenCL goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. 

**Get involved, submit your resources either with a pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/blob/master/api/openxr/resources.md)** or email the webmaster at Khronos.org.
