## OpenGL SC 1.0

**For Safety Critial applications**: OpenGL SC 1.0 is defined relative to the [OpenGL 1.3 specification](http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/version1.3/glspec13.pdf) and is designed to meet the needs of the safety critical market in Avionics, Industrial, Military and Automotive applications including D0178-B certification.

### OpenGL SC 1.0 at a glance

The Safety Critical Profile for OpenGL is defined to meet the unique requirements of the for safety-critical applications such as avionics and automotive instrumentation displays. OpenGL SC 1.0 removes functionality from [OpenGL ES 1.0](/opengles/1_X) to minimize implementation and safety certification costs. It also adds functionality, such as display lists, that are required to support legacy and auto-generated display applications in safety critical markets.
