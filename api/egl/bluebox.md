### EGL at a glance

EGL provides mechanisms for creating rendering surfaces onto which client APIs like OpenGL ES and OpenVG can draw, creates graphics contexts for client APIs, and synchronizes drawing by client APIs as well as native platform rendering APIs. This enables seamless rendering using both OpenGL ES and OpenVG for high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering.

### EGL (Native Platform Graphics Interface)

EGL Native Platform Graphics Interface is an interface portable layer for graphics resource management - and works between rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system. Learn More...
