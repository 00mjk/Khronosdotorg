The OpenMAX IL (Integration Layer) API defines a standardized media component interface to enable developers and platform providers to integrate and communicate with multimedia codecs implemented in hardware or software.

*   The OpenMAX IL 1.1.2 specification and header files are available in the [Khronos Registry](/registry/omxil/)
*   [OpenMAX IL component sample](/files/openmax/sample_implementation/OMX_CONF_MyComponent_Alt.c)
    _This source code is provided as a sample implementation of a base-profile OpenMAX IL component. Although it passed OpenMAX IL conformance tests at the time of publication, this code does not mandate how OpenMAX IL should be implemented; it is simply one example of how OpenMAX IL may be implemented. Because this sample is not being actively maintained and the conformance tests may evolve over time in subsequent revisions, it is possible that this sample will not pass all base profile conformance tests in the future._
