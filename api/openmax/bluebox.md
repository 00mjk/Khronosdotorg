    _This source code is provided as a sample implementation of a base-profile OpenMax IL component. Although it passed OpenMax conformance tests at the time of publication, this code does not mandate how OpenMax should be implemented; it is simply one example of how OpenMax may be implemented. Because this sample is not being actively maintained and the conformance tests may evolve over time in subsequent revisions, it is possible that this sample will not pass all base profile conformance tests in the future._
