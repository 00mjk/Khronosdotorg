# OpenMAX Resources

We believe the true usefulness of OpenMAX goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg)!

## Commercial and Open Source Implementations
* [LIM Open source OpenMAX IL and AL implementation](http://limoa.sourceforge.net/) Open source implementation of OpenMAX Integration Layer and Application Layer. Implementation includes IL and AL interface library, audio/video IL components and sample test codes for both IL and AL.
* [Bellagio open source OpenMAX IL sample implementation for Linux](http://omxil.sourceforge.net/) 

## Frameworks & Libraries
* [OpenMAX IL conformant Nucleus Multimedia product by Mentor Graphics](http://www.mentor.com/products/embedded_software/nucleus_rtos/multimedia/) "Nucleus Multimedia Services" is an implementation of the OpenMAX IL standard for Nucleus Real Time OS. It ships with a fully functional library of standard components which allow common audio/video playback configurations.
