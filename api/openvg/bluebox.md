## OpenVG at a glance

OpenVG is an application programming interface (API) for hardware accelerated two-dimensional vector and raster graphics. It provides a device independent and vendor-neutral interface for sophisticated 2D graphical applications, while allowing device manufacturers to provide hardware acceleration on devices ranging from wearable/consumer electronics devices to full microprocessor-based desktop and server machines.

OpenVG 1.1, released on December 8th, 2008, adds a Glyph API for hardware accelerated text rendering, full acceleration support for Adobe® Flash® and Flash Lite 3 technologies, and multi-sampled anti-aliasing to the OpenVG 1.0 specification. The OpenVG specification is accompanied by an open source reference implementation and a full suite of conformance tests implemented by the Khronos Group.

*   The OpenVG specification and header files are available in the [Khronos Registry](/registry/OpenVG/)
