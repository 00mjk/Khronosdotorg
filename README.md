# Khronos.org Website Community pages

We believe the true usefulness of Khronos Technology goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg)!

### API
The pages under API include partials from the API landing pages on Khronos.org. For example, the [opencl](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/api/opencl) folder contains the complete Resources page and the information in the Bluebox.
